# Motion Analysis
The project contains matlab and r scripts related to motion analysis. Specifically, it includes direct linear transformation, statistical parametric mapping, among several kinematics and kinetics analysis.
This is an ongoing file as I will be uploading my scripts as I refactor and add documentation to them.
