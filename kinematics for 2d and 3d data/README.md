# Kinematics for 2d and 3d data
This folder contains a MATLAB script: "crp_2d_3d.m" and its corresponding functions to perform the following tasks:
1. Importing xlsx and mqa files using xlsread function; mqa files are the coordinates obtained from the cameras using the software MaxTRAQ.
2. Performing direct linear transformation, converting 2d data from two cameras to 3d data;
3. Scaling the camera coordinates to real-world coordinates;
4. 2D data (ball): Calculation of velocity, angle, and distances;
5. 3D data (body segments): segment angles, angular velocity, segment position, and continous relative phase.



The project contains MATLAB and R scripts related to motion analysis. Specifically, it includes direct linear transformation, statistical parametric mapping, among several kinematics and kinetics analysis.
